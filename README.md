# style-guide-checklist
The purpose of this document is to help people develop style guides for website design. A clear and complete style guide can help speed up development and reduce design errors, as well as provide a valuable tool for expanding your project in the future and for quality assurance testing. They are also important pairings with traditional PSDs, as PSDs do not reflect how a site will be rendered in the web, particularly for fonts. Developers and designers can work to tweak the design in the browser and standardize that in the style guide.

# Checklist
In order to develop this checklist, I relied on this [analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tZYPnzLG0y51QinLxrV97Xflzr2MbTqwWNvaHYN04BE/edit#gid=0) of common components, as well as personal experience.

## Essentials
For a bare minimum style guide


### Type
Each type style should denote the size (ideally in pixels), line height, font, and any variations in weight (bold, light, etc.) or style (italic, underline). This would be provided for all type in the design, for example

* Paragraph text
* Heading 1
* Heading 2
* Heading 3
* Heading 4
* Blockquote
* Unordered list
* Ordered list

### Colors
What colors are used in the design?

### Anything else
For a minimalist style guide, you may want to learn back on a framework like Bootstrap for anything not defined by your style giude
